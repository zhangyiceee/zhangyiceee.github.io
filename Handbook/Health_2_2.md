# Causes and Consequences of Regional Variations in Health Care

Jonathan Skinner

There are widespread differences in health care spending and utilization across regions of the US as well as in other countries. Are these variations caused by **demand-side factors such as patient preferences, health status, income, or access?** Or are they caused by **supply-side factors such as provider financial incentives, beliefs, ability, or practice norms?** In this chapter, I first consider regional health care differences in the context of a simple demand and supply model, and then focus on the empirical evidence documenting causes of variations. While demand factors are important—health in particular—there remains strong evidence for supply-driven differences in utilization. I then consider evidence on the causal impact of spending on outcomes, and conclude that it is less important how much money is spent, and far more important how the money is spent—whether for highly effective treatments such as beta blockers or anti-retroviral treatments for AIDS patients, or ineffective treatments such as feeding tubes for advanced dementia patients.

造成健康照料的地区差异有以下两点原因：

1、假设我们观察到的差异是 "不必要的"，即它不能被诸如健康状况等合法原因所解释，那么，差异的规模是如此之大，以至于消除这种低效率的潜在收益--在美国占GDP的3%或更多--是值得追求的。

2、这些低效率不太可能被正常的竞争力量所撼动，因为供应商、消费者和第三方支付者的拼凑，每个人都面临着改善质量或降低成本的激励不足（Fuchs和Milstein，2011）。



本文考虑五个方面的基本问题

1. what are the theoretical causes of such differences?
2. use  basic framework to consider the empirical evidence on causes of geographic variation in health care utilization and expenditures.
3. what are the consequences of higher health care spending?
4. what are the policy implications of observing variations in health care utilization?

## 2. AN ECONOMIC MODEL OF REGIONAL VARIATIONS IN HEALTH CARE

### 2.1. 需求侧

建立一个两期的消费和休闲的模型，$s(x)$受到医疗花费$x$的影响
$$
V=U(C_1)+\frac{s(x)U(C_2)}{1+\delta}
$$
其中，$C_i$是第i期的消费，$\delta$是折现因子，$x$代表医疗花费。
